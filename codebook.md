Feature Selection 
=================

The features in this dataset are derived from the UCI HAR Dataset http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

Specifically, they represent the ** mean averages ** of the mean and standard deviations estimated in the original dataset grouped by subscriber (denoted by SubscriberId) and activity.

The **averages** of the following variables from the original dataset have been estimated:

* tbodyaccmeanx, tbodyaccmeany, tbodyaccmeanz - x,y and z mean body accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tbodyaccstdx, tbodyaccstdy, tbodyaccstdz - standard deviation of x,y and z body accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tgravitymeanaccx, tgravitymeanaccy, tgravitymeanaccz - x,y and z mean gravity accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tgravitystdaccx, tgravitystdaccy, tgravitystdaccz - standard deviation of x,y and z mean gravity accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tbodyaccjerkmeanx, tbodyaccjerkmeany, tbodyaccjerkmeanz - x,y and z mean instantaneous body accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tbodyaccjerkstdx, tbodyaccjerkstdy, tbodyaccjerkstdz - standard deviation of x,y and z mean instantaneous body accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tbodygyromeanx, tbodygyromeany, tbodygyromeanz - x,y and z mean body gyroscope readings in the time domain
* tbodygyrostdx, tbodygyrostdy, tbodygyrostdz - standard deviation of x,y and z mean body gyroscope readings in the time domain
* tbodygyrojerkmeanx, tbodygyrojerkmeany, tbodygyrojerkmeanz - x,y and z mean instantaneous  body gyroscope readings in the time domain

* tbodyaccmagmean - mean magnitude  body accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tbodyaccmagstd - standard deviation of mean magnitude  body accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tgravityaccmagmean - mean magnitude  gravity accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tgravityaccmagstd - mean magnitude  gravity accelerometer readings in the time domain
* tbodyaccjerkmagmean - mean magnitude  body accelerometer readings in the time domain
